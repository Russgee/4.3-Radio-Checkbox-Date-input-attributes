## 4.3 - Radio, Checkbox, Date input attributes

1. Add `type="radio"` to the first 3 inputs (male, female, and other)

2. Add `type="button"` to the 4th input with the id="btn"

3. Add the form attributes we learned prior (name, action, method) to the opening form tag. Also add `id="numberForm"` to the form tag.

**Type the word checked inside the input tags we created for male, female, and other. What did this do?**

1. Try out the radio buttons - they should work!

2. On lines 23 and 24 of the HTML, set both inputs so that `type="checkbox"`

3. On line 34 of the HTML, add `type="date"` to the input. Do the same on line 42.

Commit and Push your work to Github when done!
